These programs were used for a performance of the Lightning Thief musical. All leveraged multiple strands of neopixels in different ways with different libraries depending on the needs and what examples could be merged.  I want to thank the internets for the great tutorials, examples, and libraries.  

The fire programs used a RP2040 pico to drive 8 different neopixel outputs and accept a DMX in. 
The DMX in for fading the fire worked with wired but we didn't have time to troubleshoot it over wireless.

The lightning bolt was a plastic lighting bolt with neopixels in it that faded in and out 

The Minatour Eyes were just red.
